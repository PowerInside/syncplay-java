# SyncPlay-Java

The java implementation of the [syncplay](https://github.com/syncplay/syncplay) protocol used in [SyncPlayer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.powerinside.syncplay&hl=en).

Only client side is implemented at the moment.

## TODO

* Shared playlists.
* Migrate to a better JSON parser.
* Server side.
